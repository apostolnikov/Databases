There are the domain integrity, the entity integrity, the referential integrity and the foreign key integrity constraints.

Domain Integrity:
Domain integrity means the definition of a valid set of values for an attribute. You define 
- data type, 
- length or size
- is null value allowed
- is the value unique or not
for an attribute.

Entity Integrity Constraint:
The entity integrity constraint states that primary keys can't be null. There must be a 
proper value in the primary key field.

Referential Integrity Constraint:
The referential integrity constraint is specified between two tables and it is used to maintain the consistency among rows between the two tables.
The rules are:
1. You can't delete a record from a primary table if matching records exist in a related table.
2. You can't change a primary key value in the primary table if that record has related records.
3. You can't enter a value in the foreign key field of the related table that doesn't exist in the primary key of the primary table.
4. However, you can enter a Null value in the foreign key, specifying that the records are unrelated.

Foreign Key Integrity Constraint
There are two foreign key integrity constraints: cascade update related fields and cascade delete related rows. 
These constraints affect the referential integrity constraint.
